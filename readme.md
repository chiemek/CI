Project Overview ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project showcases a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, containerization, and deployment process using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes. The structure emphasizes automation from building the application to deploying it in a Kubernetes cluster with vulnerability testing and security scans integrated into the workflow.

1.  Folder Structure------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Takehome:
    The root folder of the project that houses the entire codebase and configurations.
    CI:
    This sub-folder contains all the files needed to manage the continuous integration pipeline, Kubernetes deployments, and Docker configurations.

2.  Contents of the CI Folder------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2.1. GitHub Actions Pipeline (YAML Files)

        The GitHub Actions YAML configuration in this folder defines the pipeline used to automate building, testing, and deploying the application. It includes:
            Triggers:
                The pipeline is triggered automatically on every git push or pull request to specified branches, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.
            Build Jobs:
                The application is built using .NET commands. This step compiles the code and ensures the app is ready for deployment.
            Static Code Analysis:
                Before building, static testing is performed to ensure that the code adheres to coding standards and has no obvious flaws.
            Application Build & Formatting:
                Once the code passes static analysis, the pipeline builds the .NET app and applies formatting checks.
            Vulnerability Testing:
                Integrated tools like Trivy and Snyk are used for vulnerability scanning of the Docker image and the source code to ensure the app is secure.
            Containerization:
                The app is containerized using Docker, and the Docker image is built and tagged with the appropriate version.
            Pushing to Docker Hub:
                The Docker image is pushed to a public/private Docker Hub repository for easy access during deployment.
            Security Scans:
                After pushing the image to Docker Hub, additional security scans are performed to identify any vulnerabilities within the image hosted on Docker Hub.
            Kubernetes Management:
                The app is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline automates the creation and updating of Kubernetes resources, ensuring that the latest version of the app is always deployed.

2.2. Kubernetes Configuration Files---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ingress File:
        This file configures the ingress controller, which manages how external traffic is routed to the application in the Kubernetes cluster.
    Kubernetes Manifest:
        This file defines the core Kubernetes objects (such as deployments and services) needed to run the application in the Kubernetes cluster. It specifies resources like pods, replicas, services, and their configuration.

2.3. Web Application (webapp)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WebApp:
        This is a simple ASP.NET Core web application created using the following command:



        dotnet new webapp

        The app serves a single page that displays the message "Hello from Emeka" when accessed.
        The application code is stored in the webapp folder inside the CI directory.

2.4. Docker Configuration------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Dockerfile:
        A Dockerfile is included to define how the web application is containerized. It specifies the base image, app dependencies, and the steps needed to build and run the .NET web app within a Docker container.
    docker-compose.yaml (if applicable):
        This file, if present, orchestrates multi-container Docker applications, but the main focus here is containerizing the web app itself.

3.  Detailed Steps for CI/CD Workflow------------------------------------------------------------------

    Folder Creation:
    First, I created a folder called Takehome to serve as the root directory for this project.
    Inside the Takehome folder, I created a sub-folder called CI that contains all the CI/CD, Kubernetes, and Docker-related configurations.

    GitHub Actions Pipeline:
    The .github directory (inside CI) holds the YAML file that defines the automated pipeline. This pipeline triggers when there’s a push to specific branches.
    The pipeline handles everything from building the application to running static code analysis, formatting checks, and scanning for vulnerabilities before deploying the app.

    Kubernetes Setup:
    Kubernetes manifests and ingress configurations (stored in the CI folder) define the resources and networking needed to run the app in a Kubernetes cluster.
    These manifest files are applied to the cluster during the CI/CD pipeline’s deployment phase.

    Application Creation:
    The web application was generated using the following command:

        dotnet new webapp

        This simple ASP.NET Core web application is located in the webapp folder within CI and is designed to print "Hello from Emeka" when accessed.

    Containerization & Deployment:
    The application is containerized using Docker, and the image is pushed to Docker Hub.
    From there, Kubernetes pulls the Docker image and deploys it within the cluster, using the ingress and manifest configurations to manage traffic and resources.
